# two-eyes-out

If a class is full at UBC, students cannot register until a seat opens in their desired sections. 

Since there is no officially offered solution other than checking the webpage regularly, 3rd party tools have been created to watch lecture web pages for openings and alert the students when a seat opens up.

*__two-eyes-out__* or _2eo_ is my solution to this problem. The current 3rd party options work very well, but lack some quality of life features that makes the experiance un-necessarily stressful

This product is still in early stages of development and there is no available version for the public yet
